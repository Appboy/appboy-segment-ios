## 3.4.0-beta1

- This release can be used to beta test iOS 14.

#### Breaking
- Updated to [Braze iOS SDK 3.27.0-beta2](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-ios-sdk/releases/tag/3.27.0-beta2).
  - Integrators will now be required to exclude the `arm64` simulator slice in their entire project. Please see the [Appboy-iOS-SDK Changelog](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-ios-sdk/blob/ios14-beta/CHANGELOG.md#changed) for more information.

## 3.3.0

#### Changed
- Updated to [Braze iOS SDK 3.26.1](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-ios-sdk/releases/tag/3.26.1).
- Deprecates the compilation macro `ABK_ENABLE_IDFA_COLLECTION` in favor of the `ABKIDFADelegate` implementation.
  - `ABK_ENABLE_IDFA_COLLECTION` will be removed in a future release and will stop functioning properly in iOS 14. To continue collecting IDFA on iOS 14 devices, you must upgrade to Xcode 12 and implement `App Tracking Transparency` and Braze's `ABKIDFADelegate` (see the [iOS 14 upgrade guide](https://www.braze.com/docs/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/ios/ios_14/#idfa-and-app-tracking-transparency) for more information).
  - `ABKIDFADelegate` can be passed in through setting [`appboyOptions`](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-segment-ios/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#added-1) on the `SEGAppboyIntegrationFactory`.

#### Added
- Added Binary Project Specification file for more efficient Carthage integration. 
  - Update your Cartfile to use `binary "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Appboy/appboy-segment-ios/master/Segment_Appboy.json"` instead of `github "appboy/appboy-segment-ios"`
  - Support for this integration method was added starting with version 3.2.0 of the SDK.

## 3.2.0

#### Added
- Added Carthage support

To install the Braze integration through Carthage, add the following lines to your `Cartfile`:
```
github "segmentio/analytics-ios"
github "appboy/appboy-segment-ios"
github "appboy/appboy-ios-sdk"
```

And run: 
```sh
carthage update
```

Follow the standard procedure to add the frameworks built/retrieved by Carthage to your project (see [Adding frameworks to an application](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#adding-frameworks-to-an-application))

#### Changed
- Updated to [Braze iOS SDK 3.24.1](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-ios-sdk/releases/tag/3.24.1).

## 3.1.0

#### Added
- Added ability to set `appboyOptions` on the `SEGAppboyIntegrationFactory` for example:
```
[SEGAppboyIntegrationFactory instance].appboyOptions = @{ABKMinimumTriggerTimeIntervalKey: @1}; 
```
The full list of options are documented in [Appboy.h](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-ios-sdk/blob/master/AppboyKit/headers/AppboyKitLibrary/Appboy.h#L35). Shout out to @maloneranger for the feature suggestion and PR. 
- Added the ability to import one of our UI subspecs instead of the full SDK. To do this, update your `Podfile` to use `Segment-Appboy/InAppMessage`, `Segment-Appboy/NewsFeed`, or `Segment-Appboy/ContentCards` instead of `Segment-Appboy`. `Segment-Appboy` will continue to use the full SDK by default. Thanks @khaptonstall!

#### Changed
- Updated to [Braze iOS SDK 3.22.0](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-ios-sdk/releases/tag/3.22.0).
- Updated code to call all Braze iOS SDK push handling methods that call UI APIs from the main thread. Thanks @gilserrap and @khaptonstall!

## 3.0.0

##### Breaking
- Log separate purchases for each product in the `products` array in a `track` call.
  - In the past we used the event name as the product ID.
  - Now if a `track` call has the event name `Order Completed` or the key `revenue` included in `properties` and also has a `products` array, we will log each object in the array as a separate purchase using `productId` as the product ID. `price` and `quantity` will be read from the individual array if available. All non-Braze recognized fields from the high level `properties` and each individual product will be combined and sent as event properties.
  - If there is no `products` array we will continue using the event name as the product ID if the key `revenue` is included in `properties`.
  
##### Added
- Added a push delegate method for apps using the `UserNotification` framework.
  - Follow our [documentation](https://www.braze.com/docs/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/ios/push_notifications/integration/#using-usernotification-framework-ios-10) for registering for push notifications using the `UserNotification` framework.
  - In `userNotificationCenter:didReceiveNotificationResponse:withCompletionHandler` add the following block of code:
  ```
  if ([Appboy sharedInstance] == nil) {
   [[SEGAppboyIntegrationFactory instance].appboyHelper saveUserNotificationCenter:center
                                                              notificationResponse:response];
  }
  [[SEGAppboyIntegrationFactory instance].appboyHelper userNotificationCenter:center
                                                 receivedNotificationResponse:response];
  if (completionHandler) {
   completionHandler();
  }
  ```

##### Breaking
- Updated to [Braze iOS SDK 3.20.0](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-ios-sdk/releases/tag/3.20.0).
- **Important:** Braze iOS SDK 3.20.0 contains updated push token registration methods. We recommend upgrading to this version as soon as possible to ensure a smooth transition as devices upgrade to iOS 13. In `application:didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:`, replace
```
[[Appboy sharedInstance] registerPushToken:
                [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@", deviceToken]];
``` 
with
```
[[Appboy sharedInstance] registerDeviceToken:deviceToken]];
```
