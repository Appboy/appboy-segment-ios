## 2.0.4
- Supports Braze 3.17.0.
  - Updates the podspec to explicitly require version 3.17.0 of the Braze iOS SDK.

## 2.0.3
- Fixed an issue where the Braze endpoint delegate would not correctly set the Segment-side configured endpoint when using Braze iOS SDK 3.14.1+.
- Added the ability to import only the `Appboy-iOS-SDK/Core` subspec instead of the full SDK. To do this, update your `Podfile` to use the `Segment-Appboy/Core` subspec instead of `Segment-Appboy`. `Segment-Appboy` will continue to use the full SDK by default. Thanks @foggy1 and @bdrelling!
